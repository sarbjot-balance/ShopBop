## 🚀 Team Contributions:-

#### Sarbjot Singh: -

Worked on the Navigation Bar and learned how to use DOM event propagation.

I managed the GitHub Repository for my team.

I’ve also made the required modifications in probably all the files we have.

Learned how to manage the team and communicate in an effective manner.
I'm a full stack developer...

#### Vishwas Kumar:-

I worked on the Product Page & tried to clone it exactly like the original website’s page. I have used JSON and a local API server for storing the data and fetching the data to show the products on all product pages. I also have used the local storage ( to store and get data) to store the add-to-cart item in each section.

I used HTML, CSS, JS, API, and Local-Storage ( to store and get data) in JavaScript.

Here we have learned how to work and communicate with a team. We all came to know how to use Github and push and clone the code from Github.

Also, we have learned how to work under pressure conditions. I would like to thank my team members for their support.

#### Vishal Kumar: -

I worked on the Home page & Footer section of the website and try to clone exact same as the original.

I have used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

#### Narendra Kandalkar:-

I worked on the login, and signup page and tried to clone it exactly like the original website’s page
